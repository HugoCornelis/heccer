    <h1>Functional Tests for Heccer</h1>

    Below you find all the test specifications for Heccer.  Most tests
    run a single executables with a low-level model hardcoded in C,
    and check the generated output.  The level of testing is
    functional, functionality directly experienced by the user.
    Low-level unit tests, e.g. of the minimum-degree algorithm that
    Heccer uses to investigate a neuron's morphology are missing.

    <p>

      These tests give a general idea of what Heccer does and how it
      works.  The test code gives examples of how Heccer can be used
      in a stand-alone mode.

    <p>

    The separate SSP package delivers integration tests with the
    Neurospaces model container.
