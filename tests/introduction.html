    <h1>Functional Tests for Heccer</h1>

    Below you find all the test specifications for Heccer.  The tests
    consist mainly of running single executables with a hardcoded
    model, and checking the generated output.  See the SSP package for
    integration tests with Neurospaces.

    <p>

      These tests should give a broad idea of what Heccer does, and
      the test code gives a very good idea of how to use Heccer
      stand-alone.  The level of testing is functional, ie. user
      experienced functionality (ie. no low-level unit tests).
