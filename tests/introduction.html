    <h1>Functional Tests for Heccer</h1>

    Below you will find all the test specifications for Heccer.  Most
    tests run a single executable with a low-level model hardcoded in
    C, then check the generated output.  Testing is functional, at the
    level of functionality directly experienced by the user.
    Low-level unit tests, e.g. tests for the minimum-degree algorithm
    that Heccer uses to investigate a neuron's morphology, are not
    implemented.

    <p>

      These tests give a general idea of what Heccer does and how it
      works.  The test code gives examples of how Heccer can be used
      in a stand-alone mode.

    <p>

    The separate SSP package delivers integration tests with the
    Neurospaces model container.
