* write documentation for heccer callouts

* Implement rule de l'hopital in the tabulator.
See tests/genesis/hopital for a validation example.

* serialization
must be serialized:
** everything in struct VM
special cases
*** struct MopsSpringMass.pdEvents
*** struct MatsCallout.pco
*** union uMC2Mat.pdValue
**** struct MopsEventGenerate
**** struct MopsInternalNernst
**** struct MopsInitializeChannelErev
**** struct MopsSingleGateConcept
**** struct MopsExponentialDecay
See HeccerMechanismLink(), search for all '->u' instances.

* table index addressing
Results are cast from int to void * back to int.  I guess that some of
the functions are doing to much work, ie. there is not a clean
separation of concerns.

* compilation of outputs
truncates output files, perhaps that should be moved to the initiation
sequence ?  Would be handy if starting the studio from ssp, output
files would not be truncated.

* add double exp. for ca pools
See chat with Paolo.

* test config
get_current_revision_id is being used, but that gives an wrong
revision id on an unchanged workspace, or I cannot figure out what it
is doing.

* addressing, output generator and vclamp
Variables should be (double *) instead of (void *).

* passive-only option
** open issues
probably both of these, for interfacing consistency:
*** should be at level of the integrator ?
So mechanisms never propagate to the intermediary ?
*** should be at the level of the compiler ?
So mechanisms are filtered out by the compilers ?
**** in HeccerMechanismCompile()
All the mechanisms, except springmass are skipped.  This is supposed
to be tracked automatically by the mechanism indexing, so should work
like that.
** implement tests for the passive-only option

* some tests don't work on ric-neurospaces-02
check files heccer-tables.output and heccer-spikes.output.  Perhaps
related to not recompiling heccer and integrating the proper
neurospaces library.

* running tests on a user machine
requires mtn installed, because the test.config tries to execute mtn.

* the tests/tests directory is part of the distribution, somehow.

* add springmass channels to the perl glue
** add events
** add springmass2 test
based on the springmass4 test
check if the same test output can be used.

* configure
** Check for the neurospaces.h file
then set the variable to compile the neurospaces integrator (or not).
** solve the heccer/neurospaces dependencies that Mike Schachter reported.

* add the mtn revision to the dist, somehow.

* the output of the tests sometimes goes to /tmp/output
Must be a unique filename due to ownership.  New users cannot remove
the file when it is owned by a different user.
       #include <stdio.h>
       char *tmpnam(char *s);
and write the name of the generated filename to the test output in
case needed.

* Perhaps I should drand48() for Linux rng
Is declared obsoleted, see man page.

* SETMAT_FLUXPOOL initial value
Because ->iPool is only used as a boolean indicator, we can replace it
with ->dInitFlux, with a value of FLT_MAX meaning no flux must be
calculated.

* internal state serializer
** serializes the complete internal state
** can be used from SSP, to save the full state of a model
** files can be reloaded by a stand-alone heccer for debugging
** depending on options, only serializes the model state
and not the model structure.

* integrators
rename to 'interfaces', to stress the loose coupling.
** Heccer.pm mentions 'intergrator plugin'
Needs to be adapted.
** neurospaces interface
has fixed size buffers, see two commits ago.  Remove fixed size buffers.

* addressing
Last mechanism can not have more than one output, see addressing.c
TODO developer comments.

* perl glue
comp2mech entry should default to -1 terminated array of all zeros,
when there are no mechanisms.

* intermediary concy checker
** number of entries in comp2mech
** values of comp2mech entries

* Revisit the compartments mops and mats
Needs update of all tests (also in ssp).
** mats: inject
** mops: all the others

* Revisit the channel definitions to generalize
The members of the channel structures should be more easily
understandable, and, as far as possible, be shared between the
different definitions, such that the procedures below, and their
associated data structures (in mechanism.h) have one common worker
algorithm.
** HeccerBasalActivatorTabulate
** HeccerChannelPersistentSteadyStateDualTauTabulate
** HeccerChannelPersistentSteadyStateTauTabulate
** HeccerChannelSteadyStateSteppedTauTabulate
** HeccerDiscretizeBasalActivator
** HeccerDiscretizeGateConcept
** HeccerGateConceptTabulate

* ChannelSteadyStateSteppedTau
** check if members have correct names
According to the Genesis documentation, the time constant comes from
the first table, the steady state from the second.

* swig interface
** implement callouts
#t callbacks and swig are still a problem, solutions for python seem
#t more easy that for perl.
