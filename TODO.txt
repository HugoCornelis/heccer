* configure
Check for the neurospaces.h file, then set the variable to compile the
neurospaces integrator (or not).

* Revisit the compartments mops and mats
Needs update of all tests (also in ssp).
** mats: inject
** mops: all the others

* Revisit the channel definitions to generalize
The members of the channel structures should be more easily
understandable, and, as far as possible, be shared between the
different definitions, such that the procedures below, and their
associated data structures (in mechanism.h) have one common worker
algorithm.
** HeccerBasalActivatorTabulate
** HeccerChannelPersistentSteadyStateDualTauTabulate
** HeccerChannelPersistentSteadyStateTauTabulate
** HeccerChannelSteadyStateSteppedTauTabulate
** HeccerDiscretizeBasalActivator
** HeccerDiscretizeGateConcept
** HeccerGateConceptTabulate

* ChannelSteadyStateSteppedTau
** check if members have correct names
According to the Genesis documentation, the time constant comes from
the first table, the steady state from the second.

* swig interface
** implement callouts
#t callbacks and swig are still a problem, solutions for python seem
#t more easy that for perl.
